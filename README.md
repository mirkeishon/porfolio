<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![portfolio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94877748/155682835-3958ff58-edb0-48c5-b49f-fa2be3a37f61.png)

- You can find the demo in this [url](https://porfolio-two-pied.vercel.app/)

- This page helped me to understand important concepts about next.js, the GROQ syntax, I discovered Sanity CMS, I took my first Steps on typescript, SSR(Server-side Rendering), and ISR(Incremental Static Regeneration), I honed a bit my knowledge about Tailwind CSS and I started learning about photoshop for logo design.

## Acknowledgements

<!-- This section should list any articles or add-ons/plugins that helps you to complete the project. This is optional but it will help you in the future. For example -->

- [medium 2.0 from Sonny Sangha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2dcpatq54o&t=431s), for sanity cms, next.js, ssr, isr and typescript;
- [Monogram logo Photoshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbM-lDblWt8&pp=ugMICgJlcxABGAE%3D), I don't know a lot about design and those things so this helped me a lot to start learning about it
